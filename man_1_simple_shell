.SH NAME
    Holberton Simple Shell

.SH SYNOPSIS 
    hsh

.SH DESCRIPTION
    The  Holberton Simple Shell is a command language interpeter that executes commands 
    of the kernel trough standar input. Shell input and output redirections 
    have an implementation defined offset maximum that is established in the
    open file description.

.SH OPERANDS

        -        A single <hyphen-minus> shall be treated as the first
                 operand and then ignored. If both '-' and "--" are
                 given as arguments, or if other operands precede the
                 single <hyphen-minus>, the results are undefined.

    argument     The positional parameters ($1, $2, and so on) shall be
                 set to arguments, if any.


.SH EXAMPLES

    Interactive mode:

                $ ./hsh
                ($) /bin/ls
                hsh main.c shell.c
                ($)
                ($) exit
                $

    Non-interactive mode:

                $ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
                hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
                $
                $ cat test_ls_2
                /bin/ls
                /bin/ls
                $
                $ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
                hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
                hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
                $

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:

    ENV         This variable, when and only when an interactive shell
                 is invoked, shall be subjected to parameter expansion
                 by the shell, and the resulting value shall be used as
                 a pathname of a file containing shell commands to exe-
                 cute in the current environment.  

    PWD         An absolute pathname of the current working directory.
